          <p> X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism is a rare, devasting 
         neurodegenerative disorder which affects descendants from
         the Panay Island, Philippines. Its pathology shares similarities
         with a number of other prominent illnesses, including Hungtinton's
         Disease and Parkinson's Disease. These factors, in addition to the
         devastating consequences of the disease on impacted individuals in 
         the Philippines who cannot afford expensive medical treatment, makes
         finding a cost-effective cure crucial.
         In this app, you will be able to explore the background of XDP, and
         understand a new fly model designed to screen for gene targets which,
         when silenced, restores <q>XDP</q> fly survival rates and eye size,
         and thus may also rescue the damage caused by the disease in human
         patients as well. You will be able to see the distribution of eye sizes,
         fly survival rates after knockdown, correlation between sex, time of week,
         and various genetic pathways that may hold keys to a future cure.

          This project is made possible by groundbreaking individuals actively
          researching, teaching, and collecting financial and political support
          for XDP research. Many thanks to Geraldine Acuna-Sunshine, a board member 
          of the Harvard Board of Overseers and the founder of Sunshine Care Foundation
          which funds the Life Sciences 100 course through which these experiments were
          carried out under the supervision of professor Alain Viel. Naoto Ito and 
          Noriko Wakabayashi developed the novel Drosophila screening model. Cris Bragg,
          MD, the director of the Center for XDP Research at MGH, provided direction for the
          use of the CMAP and targeted genes. Finally, the execution of 
          the data gathered here are a cumulation of more than 18,000 hand-recorded fly datapoints
          over 480 hours by six Harvard undergraduates: Matthew Li, Minjue Wu, Paul Doan,
          Toni Scott, Michelle Lara, and Jessica Miller.
